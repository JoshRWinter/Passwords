Passwords is a simple desktop password manager for Linux and Windows that can store all your passwords and keep them safe for you -- locked behind your Master Password

The password database is encrypted using OpenSSL with AES-256 (CBC)

Passwords uses Qt 5.9 and is written in c++. A C++17 compiler is required for compilation.
